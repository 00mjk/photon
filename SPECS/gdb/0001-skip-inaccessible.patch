Subject: [PATCH] gdb: Stop inaccessible region from getting dumped

Background : 7.12 onward version of gdb started dumping some
inaccessible regions (e.g: alignment gaps) in coredump, which
is increasing the size of core file. Bug 2564068 was raised
for this issue.

Fix:
If a memory region in smaps file is having anonymous keyword
and "read, write and execute" flags are "not set"
Then that memory region is inaccessible, so should not be dumped.
