rdppm.c: Fix buf overrun caused by bad binary PPM

This extends the fix in 1e81b0c to
include binary PPM files with maximum values < 255, thus preventing a
malformed binary PPM input file with those specifications from
triggering an overrun of the rescale array and potentially crashing
cjpeg, TJBench, or any program that uses the tjLoadImage() function.
